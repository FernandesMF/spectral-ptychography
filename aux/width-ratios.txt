Goodness of results with 10^4 average total counts

Ratio of widths (sig_pdf/sig_wfn)	Good?
2	Not really...
1.5	Decent central width, but some ripples aside...
1	Pretty good, minor ripples
0.85	Pretty good, some ripples
0.7	Good, ripples are really small
0.6	Quite good, almost no ripples
0.5	Outstanding, no ripples even with less counts

Ok, I think we should aim for ratios between 0.7 to 0.5!
